Dog-Ate-My-Homework
===================

This is a website thatI am inviting other Skillcrush Alum to become contributors to. I want to learn how to use Github
setup files that others can contribute to and the best way to do that is to practice.

If you are a contributor, feel free to change the website however you want. In the future, I may change that and 
make "assignments" to mimic a real work situtation. 

Feel free to ask questions. 

Thanks for helping me learn!
