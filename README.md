Dog-Ate-My-Homework
===================

This is a website thatI am inviting other Skillcrush Alum to become contributors to. I want to learn how to use Github
to set up files that others can contribute to and the best way to do that is to practice.

Contact me if you want to be added as a contributor. If you are a contributor, feel free to change the website however you want. In the future, I may change that and make "assignments" to mimic a real work situtation. 

Feel free to ask questions. 

Thanks for helping me learn!
